Provides an API for storing, retrieving and deleting streams of bits in
a transactionally safe fashion. The main class is
<a href="BitstreamStorageManager.html">BitstreamStorageManager</a>.

<h2>Using the Bitstore API</h2>

<p>
An example use of the Bitstore API is shown below:
<pre>
    // Create or obtain a context object
    Context context;
    // Stream to store
    InputStream stream;
    
    try
    {
        // Store the stream
        int id = BitstreamStorageManager.store (context, stream);
        // Retrieve it
        InputStream retrieved = BitstreamStorageManager.retrieve(context, id);
        // Delete it
        BitstreamStorageManager.delete(context, id);

        // Complete the context object so changes are written
    }
    // Error with I/O operations
    catch (IOException ioe)
    {
       
    }
    // Database error
    catch (SQLException sqle)
    {
    }
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Storage mechanism</h2>

<p>
The BitstreamStorageManager stores its data under the directory
given by the configuration property <em>assetstore.dir</em>.
When given a stream of bits to store, the BitstreamStorageManager
generates a unique key for the stream. The key takes the form of
a long sequence of digits, which is transformed into a file path.
The BitstreamStorageManager stores the contents of the stream in
this path, creating parent directories as necessary.
</p>

<h3>Changing the location of the Asset Store</h3>

To change the location of the asset store, do the following:

<ol>
  <li>Shut down the DSpace system.
  <li>Move the asset store directory to the new location.
  <!-- FIXME: This should refer DSpace configuration info -->
  <li>Change the configuration property <em>assetstore.dir</em>
      to refer to the new location.
  <li>Restart the DSpace system.
</ol>

No database changes are necessary.

<h2>The Bitstore and Transactions</h2>

<p>
The bitstore is carefully engineered to prevent data loss, using
transactional flags in the database. Before a bitstream is 
actually stored, a metadata entry with the unique bitstream id is
committed to the database. If the storage operations fails or is
aborted, the deleted flag remains, and the bitstore API ensures
that the bitstream cannot be retrieved. Only when all of the
</p>

<p>
Similarly, bitstreams are deleted by simply setting the
deleted flag. 
</p>

<h2>Cleaning up the Asset Store</h2>

As noted above, sometimes files will be physically present in the
Asset Store even though they are marked deleted in the database.
You can use the command-line utility class
<code>org.dspace.storage.bitstore.Cleanup</code>
to remove the bitstreams which are marked deleted from the Asset Store.
