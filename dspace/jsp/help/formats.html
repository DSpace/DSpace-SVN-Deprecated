<h3>Currently supported formats</h3>

<p>
In the table below, <b>MIME type</b> is the Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) type identifier; for more
information on MIME, see the <a href="http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/MIME.html">MIME RFCs</a> or the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/mail/mime-faq/">MIME FAQ</a>.
<b>Description</b> is what most people use as the name for the format.
<b>Extensions</b> are typical file name extensions (the part after the
dot, e.g. the extension for "index.html" is "html").  These are not
case-sensitive in DSpace, so either "sample.XML" or "sample.xml" will
be recognized as XML.
<b>Level</b> is DSpace's support level for each format:  
</p>

<dl>
<p>

<h3>DSpace Format Support Policy</h3>
<p>
We want to provide support for as many file formats as
possible.  Over time, items stored in DSpace will be preserved
as is, using a combination of time-honored techniques for data
management and best practices for digital preservation.  As for
specific formats, however, the proprietary nature of many file
types makes it impossible to guarantee much more than this.  Put
simply, our policy for file formats is:
</p>

<ul>
<li>everything put in will be retrievable</li>
<li>we will recognize as many files' formats as possible</li>
<li>we will support as many known file formats as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>
By "support", we mean "make useable in the future, using whatever 
combination of techniques (such as migration, emulation, etc.) is
appropriate given the context of need".  For supported
formats, we might choose to bulk-transform files from a current
format version to a future one, for instance.  But we can't predict
which services will be necessary down the road, so we'll continually
monitor formats and techniques to ensure we can accomodate needs
as they arise.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, we can choose to "support" a format if we
can gather enough documentation to capture how the format
works.  In particular, we collect file specifications,
descriptions, and code samples, and make those available in the
<!-- FIXME: Make a link! <a href="submit_guide.html#info">-->
DSpace Format Reference Collection<!-- FIXME </a>-->. 
Unfortunately, this
means that proprietary formats for which these materials are not
publicly available cannot be supported in DSpace.  We will still
preserve these files, and in cases where those formats are
native to tools supported, we will
provide you with guidance on converting your files into formats
we do support.  It is also likely that for extremely popular but
proprietary formats (such as Microsoft .doc, .xls, and .ppt), 
we will be able to help make files in those
formats more useful in the future simply because their
prevalence makes it likely tools will be available.  Even so, we
cannot guarantee this level of service without also having more
information about the formats, so we will still list these
formats as "known", not "supported".
</p>

<a name="notlisted"></a>
<h3>What to do if your format isn't listed</h3>

<p>
We understand that there are always more formats to consider, and we would 
appreciate your help in identifying and studying the suitability of
support for formats you care about.  If we can't identify a format,
DSpace will record it as "unknown", aka "application/octet-stream",
but we would like to keep the percentage of supported format
materials in DSpace as high as possible.  Don't hesitate to <a
href="index.html#help">contact us</a> if you have any questions or concerns.
