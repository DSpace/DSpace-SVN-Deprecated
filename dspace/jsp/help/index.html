<p>DSpace captures, distributes and preserves MIT's digital research products. 
  Here you can find articles, working papers, preprints, technical reports, conference 
  papers and data sets in various digital formats. Our content grows daily as 
  new communities and collections are added to DSpace.</p>
<p>The DSpace content is organized around Communities which correspond to MIT 
  administrative entities such as schools, departments, labs and research centers. 
  Within each community there can be an unlimited number of collections. Within 
  each collection there can be an unlimited number of items.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="browse"><b>BROWSE</b></p>
<p><b>Browse</b> allows you to go through a list of items 
  in some specified order:</p>
<p><b>Browse by Community/Collection</b> takes you through the communities in 
  alphabetical order and allows you to see the collections within each community.</p>
<p><b>Browse by Title</b> allows you to move through an alphabical list of titles 
  of all items in DSpace in alphabetical order.</p>
<p><b>Browse by Author</b> allows you to move through an alphabetical list of 
  all authors of items in DSpace.</p>
<p><b>Browse by Date </b>allows you to move through a list of all items in DSpace 
  in reverse chronological order.</p>
<p><b>Members</b> are currently those people who either have authorization to 
  submit items to DSpace or who have some capacity to work with the submissions 
  within a community or collection. In the future there will be another membership 
  category offering services such as e-mail notification when new items are added 
  to a collection or community.</p>
<p><b>Submit</b> is the DSpace function that enables MIT users to add an item 
  to DSpace. The process of submission includes filling out information about 
  the item on a metadata form and uploading the file(s) comprising the digital 
  item. Each community sets its own submission policy. See <a href="submit_guide.html"><i>The 
  Inessential Guide to Submitting Items into DSpace</i></a> for an introduction 
  to this process.</p>
<p><b>My DSpace</b> is a personal page that is maintained for each member. This 
  page can contain a list of items that are in the submission process for a particular 
  member, or a task list of items that need attention such as editing, reviewing, 
  or checking. In the future this page will also maintain information about personal 
  services offered by DSpace, such as e-mail notification when new items are added 
  to a collection.</p>
<p><b>Edit Profile</b> allows you to change your password.</p>
<p><b>About</b> takes you to information about the DSpace project and its development.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="search"></a><b>SEARCH</b> </p>
<p>To search all of DSpace, use the yellow search box at the top of the navigation 
  bar on the left (or the search box in the middle of the home page)</p>
        <p align="center"> <img src="searchtop.gif" width="119" height="53"> </p>
<p> To limit your search to a specific community or collection, navigate to that 
  community or collection and use the search bar on that page.</p>
    <p align="center"> <img src="searchother.gif" width="253" height="69"></p>
<p>DSpace uses the<b> Jakarta Lucene </b>search engine. Here are some search hints:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>What is searched<br>
    </b>The word(s) you enter in the search box will be searched against the title, 
    author, keyword and abstract fields of each item's record. </p>
  <p><b>What is not searched - Stop Words<br>
    </b>The<b> </b>search engine ignores certain words that occurr frequently 
    in English, but do not add value to the search. These are: </p>
  <p align="center"> "a", "and" , "are" , "as" , "at" , "be" , "but" , "by" , 
    "for" , "if" , "in" , "into", </p>
  <p align="center">"is" ,"it" ,"no" , "not" , "of" , "on" , "or" , "such", "the" 
    , "to" , "was"</p>
  <p><b>Truncation<br>
    </b>Use an asterisk (*) after a word stem to get all hits having words starting 
    with that root, for example: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="search1.gif" width="75" height="27"> &nbsp &nbsp will retrieve 
      selects, selector, selectman, selecting. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Stemming <br>
    </b>The search engine automatically expands words with common endings to include 
    plurals, past tenses ...etc.</p>
  <p><b>Phrase Searching</b><br>
     To search using multiple words as a phrase, put quotation marks 
(&quot;) around the phrase.</p>
  <p><img src="search8.jpg" width="196" height="28"> </p>
  <p><b>Exact word match</b><br>
    Put a plus (+) sign before a word if it MUST appear in the search result. 
    For instance, in the following search the word &quot;training&quot; is optional, 
    but the word &quot;dog&quot; must be in the result. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="search2.gif" width="123" height="27"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Eliminate items with unwanted words<br>
    </b>Put a minus (-) sign before a word if it should not appear in the search 
    results. Alternatively, you can use <b>NOT</b>. This can limit your search 
    to eliminate unwanted hits. For instance, in the search</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="search3.jpg" width="124" height="28"> &nbsp or &nbsp <img src="search4.jpg" width="136" height="28"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>you will get items containing the word &quot;training&quot;, except those 
    that also contain the word &quot;cat&quot;.</p>
  <p><b>Boolean searching</b></p>
  <p>The following Boolean operators can be used to combine terms. Note that they 
    must be CAPITALIZED !</p>
  <p><b>AND</b> - to limit searches to find items containing all words or phrases 
    combined with this operator, e.g.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <img src="search5.jpg" width="124" height="28"> will retrieve all items 
      that contain BOTH the words &quot;cats&quot; and &quot;dogs&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>OR</b> - to enlarge searches to find items containing any of the words 
    or phrases surrounding this operator </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="search6.jpg" width="124" height="28"> will retrieve all items 
      that contain EITHER the words &quot;cats&quot; or &quot;dogs&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>NOT - </b>to exclude items containing the word following this operator, 
    e.g. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><img src="search4.jpg" width="136" height="28">will retrieve all items 
      that contain the word &quot;training&quot; EXCEPT those also containing 
      the word &quot;cat&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Parentheses can be used in the search query to group search terms into sets, 
    and operators can then be applied to the whole set, e.g.</p>
  <p><img src="search7.jpg" width="340" height="28"> </p>
</blockquote>

format in the list, click on "format not in list" and describe the format in the
text box lower down on the page.  Be sure to give the name of the application
you used to create the file and the version of that application, for example
&quot;Autodesk AutoCAD R20 for UNIX&quot;.</p>

<p><b><a name="uploadedfile"></a>Uploaded File</b></p>

<p>After you have uploaded a file, check the information in the table to make
sure it is correct.  There are two further ways to verify that your files have
been uploaded correctly:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Click on the filename. This will download the file in a new browser window, 
    so that you can check the contents. </li>
  <li>Compare the <a href="#checksum">file checksum</a> displayed here with the checksum you calculate. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>If you're only uploading one file</b>, click on "Next" when you're happy
that the file has been uploaded correctly.</p>

<p><b>If you're uploading more than one file</b>, click on the &quot;Upload
Another File&quot;  button.  When you are satisfied that all files for this item have been successfully 
  uploaded, click on the &quot;Finished Uploading Files&quot; button. </p>


<p><b><a name="checksum"></a> Checksums </b></p>
<p>DSpace generates an MD5 checksum for every file it stores; we use this checksum 
  internally to verify the integrity of files over time (a file's checksum shouldn't 
  change). You can use this checksum to be sure what we've received is indeed 
  the file you've uploaded.</p>
<p>To do this, click "Show checksums" on the "Uploaded 
  File" page. The DSpace-generated MD5 checksum for every file we've received 
  from you will show to the right of the filename.</p>
<p>You will need to use a local program to generate your own checksum for these 
  files, and verify that your results match ours. On most UNIX-like systems (including 
  athena and Mac OS X), use md5sum. For instance, type "md5sum MYFILE" for every file you want 
  to check; the summary should print on your screen.</p>
<p>For Windows machines, MD5 tools are freely available: try md5 (from <a 
  href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/</a>), or
  md5sum, available via the textutils package in Cygwin (<a 
  href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>).</p>

<p>DSpace requires agreement to this non-exclusive distribution license before

<p>Now that your submission has been successfully entered into the DSpace system, 
  it will go through the workflow process designated for the collection to which 
  you are submitting. Some collections require the submission to go through editing 
  or review steps, while others may immediately accept the submission. You will 
  receive e-mail notification as soon as your item has become a part of the collection, 
  or if for some reason there is a problem with your submission. If you have questions 
  about the workflow procedures for a particular collection, please contact the 
  community responsible for the collection directly. You can check on the status 
  of your submission by going to the My DSpace page.</p>

<p><a name="handle"></a><b>Handle</b></p>
<p>When your item becomes a part of the DSpace repository it is assigned a persistent 
  URL. This means that, unlike most URLs, this identifier will not have to be 
  changed when the system migrates to new hardware, or when changes are made to 
  the system. DSpace (through MIT Libraries) is committed to maintaining the integrity 
  of this identifier so that you can safely use it to refer to your item when 
  citing it in publications or other communications. Our persistent urls are registered 
  with the <a href="http://www.handle.net/">Handle System</a>, a comprehensive 
  system for assigning, managing, and resolving persistent identifiers, known 
  as "handles," for digital objects and other resources on the Internet. The Handle 
  System is administered by the <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/">Corporation 
  for National Research Initiatives (CNRI)</a>, which undertakes, fosters, and 
  promotes research in the public interest.</p>
