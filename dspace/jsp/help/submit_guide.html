<h2>The Inessential Guide to Submitting Items into DSpace</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right"><a href="index.jsp">return to main help</a></p>
<p>
DSpace is a service built using a software
platform jointly developed by Hewlett-Packard Company and MIT.
DSpace can be used as a long-term storage system for
digital documents; it captures, preserves, and provides access to
the research output of researchers, centers, and labs.
</p>

<p>
This document gives a brief overview of how DSpace works. It
is oriented to help anyone get started submitting to DSpace
quickly.  Because DSpace is not your run-of-the-mill content
management system, we hope you'll review the concepts presented
here, and that doing so will help you prepare and submit your
files more smoothly.
</p>

<p>
On to the overview!  First, two meta-points:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
This is a very simplified overview of DSpace; there is 
much more extensive documentation available within DSpace itself
and elsewhere, some of which is referenced in this document.  If
you don't see what you need to know, don't hesitate to <a
href="#help">contact us</a>.
</li>

<li>
This guide is geared toward those who intend to submit a
small number (one, or a handful, but not thousands!) of files
for storage in DSpace.  This would apply to you if you want to
store an article, or some images, or code, or if you're in a
position where you might be regularly asked to submit an article
or working paper on behalf of others, but not necessarily many
at once.  We've developed a web interface for uploading content
which we think you'll find straightforward for occasional or
regular uploads, but we have other tools for loading a large
bulk of content at once.  If you have a large collection of
digital materials you'd like to load into DSpace, please contact
us directly and we can discuss what the best approach for you
might be.
</li>

</ol>


<h3>What you need to know about submitting to DSpace</h3>

<h4>The Submission Process</h4>

<p>
You will need to be logged in to DSpace before you can
submit. Most collections will also require specific
authorization for you before you can submit to it.  Contact the
organizers of the collection to which you wish to submit if you
are unsure whether you have permission.
</p>

<p>
After starting a submission, you will be led through a
seven-step process:  these include some basic questions about
your materials first, then several screens where you can
describe your materials (see <a href="#metadata">metadata</a>
below), then file uploads, a verification screen (where you can
even compare file checksums if you wish), and a license granting
screen.  Each of these steps has more detailed documentation
available as links on each screen.
</p>

<p>
After you finish, the folks administering the collection to
which you are submitting may review, edit, or approve your
submission according to the collection's policies.  In other
words, your materials might _not_ go directly into the archive.
Check with the organizers of your collection for their policy if
you want to know how it will work.
</p>


<h4>On the Organization of DSpace</h4>

<p>
DSpace content is organized into communities, with logical
groups of materials organized into collections within individual
communities. The atomic unit of content in DSpace is an "item",
a.k.a. one "thing", whether that's a single file article, or a
single dataset made of several files, or several file format
versions of the same image.  Take a look at the communities overview, and 
browse some DSpace items to get a feel
for how it works.
</p>


<a name="metadata">
<h4>On Metadata in DSpace</h4>

<p>
In collections as big as
libraries, of which DSpace is just a part, being able to find a
single item or a set of relevant items for a given user in some
context of information need is very dependent on the quality and
consistency of descriptive information available for querying. 
Some description can be done mechanically: file sizes,
checksums, and full-text indexing, for instance, are critical
elements, so we've built those in.  But we also need a higher
order of human-made description, to determine things like
titles, authors, unique identifiers, and abstracts.  If DSpace
handled just one genre of content (say, just articles), we could
standardize formats and templates to make this easier.  DSpace
handles many genres, and many formats, however, so we need your
help in providing this description.
</p>

<p>
DSpace uses a qualified version of <a
href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> as a descriptive
lingua franca across all content.  Some communities or
collections may also have tailored metadata available (such as
MARC records for book collections, or FGDC records for
geographic datasets). But even where that's available for some
items, we crosswalk more detailed metadata records into our
Dublin Core vocabulary to ensure a common layer of descriptive
specificity for browsing and searching across everything.  The
"describe" pages in the submission interface map the values you
enter to our vocabulary:  what you enter will be what others use
to find your content in the future.  So please take a moment to
read the explanations of each field, check the help screens,
and read our vocabulary <a href="#info">documentation</a> if
you're interested.  
</p>



<a name="formats">
<h4>On File Formats</h4>

<p>
Over time, items stored in DSpace will be preserved
using a combination of time-honored techniques for data
management and best practices for digital preservation.  As for
specific file formats, however, obsolescence and proprietary 
formats make it impossible to guarantee the exact same level of
preservation support services for every file.  
</p>

<p>
We have written a format support policy that we believe balances
the needs of most researchers with the long-term reality and costs
of supporting changing technologies over time.  Put simply, our 
policy for file formats is:
</p>

<ul>
<li>everything put into DSpace will be retrievable</li>
<li>we will recognize as many files' formats as possible</li>
<li>we will support as many known file formats as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>
Complete documentation of this policy, including
a list of currently known and supported formats, is available in
<a href="formats.html">DSpace Supported Formats</a>.  That document
explains exactly what we mean by "support", and explains what to do
if you have files with formats that aren't already listed.
</p>


<a name="access">
<h4>Access control</h4>

<p>
DSpace implements access controls so items requiring usage
restrictions will be properly limited.  Some collections are
limited to local network access only, for instance; other 
materials might be made freely available to anyone in the
world.  Please ask your collection's administrators what the
collection's default access policies are.  If you have an item
that requires a different level of control than the default,
please let the administrators know, and we can work together to
set your items up properly.
</p>

<p>
If you are at all unsure about whether you have permission
to submit a particular item to DSpace, don't do it!  Get in touch
with us and we'll help figure it out what will be best.

<a name="help">
<h4>Where to Go for Help</h4>

<p>
The fastest ways to contact DSpace support staff are via our
support line, 555-555-1234, or via our help list,
dspace-help(@)myu.edu.  You can quickly send email to our help
list from anywhere in DSpace; just click "feedback" at the bottom
of any page.  Be sure to give us a valid email address so we can
respond.
