The reference version of the documentation is now contained in the
docbook/ subdirectory.

This version generates the contents of the pdf/ and html/ subdirectories.

The docbook was generated from the earlier html files that are now in
html.legacy/.

Any additions or edits should be done to the files in docbook/.

The script that can handle conversion is in convert2db.sh, and it
uses the wrapscreen.py script.

In the near future, the legacy html will be removed, as will be the pdf
and html directories.  The conversion scripts will be integrated into
the maven build.

For today, please read either the pdf/ or html/ versions of the docs,
and place edits into the docbook/ version.
