<h1><a name="Preface-Preface"></a>Preface</h1>

<p>Welcome to Release 1.7.0! The committers have volunteered many hours to fix, re-write and contribute new software code for this release. Documentation has also been updated. </p>

<p>The following is a list of the new features included for release 1.7.0 (not an exhaustive list):</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="Mirage Configuration and Customization.html" title="Mirage Configuration and Customization">Mirage</a>: a new clean, professional looking theme for XMLUI that eases theme development</li>
	<li>DSpace Discovery: a faceted browse/search interface for XMLUI that gives a deeper and more intuitive look at repository content</li>
	<li><a href="AIP Backup and Restore.html" title="AIP Backup and Restore">Archival Information Package (AIP) Backup &amp; Restore process</a>: allows for a backup of DSpace into a generic METS-based structure, that can be used to migrate DSpace content to another system that supports AIP's (DSpace or non-DSpace)</li>
	<li><a href="Curation System.html" title="Curation System">Curation System User Interface</a>: allows for a series of curation tasks (profile bitstream formats, virus scan, check for required metadata) to be performed on objects in DSpace</li>
	<li>PowerPoint text extraction, for searching within PowerPoint slides</li>
	<li>Improved <a href="Google Scholar Metadata Mappings.html" title="Google Scholar Metadata Mappings">Google Scholar indexing</a> on metadata and PDF content</li>
	<li>Improved performance and scalability of DSpace: the code has been thoroughly analyzed to provide major performance gains with regard to item ingestion and indexing speed to support larger repositories</li>
	<li>Automated Unit Testing of core code: helps the developers ensure the core code of DSpace is as bug free and stable as possible</li>
</ul>


<p>A full list of all changes / bug fixes in 1.7.0 is available in the <a href="History.html" title="History">History</a> section.</p>

We offer thanks to those institutions for supporting their staff to take time to contribute to the DSpace project.</p>

<p>We apologize to any contributor accidentally left off this list. DSpace has such a large, active development community that we sometimes lose track of all our contributors. Our ongoing list of all known people/institutions that have contributed to DSpace software can be found on our <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpaceContributors" title="DSpaceContributors">DSpace Contributors page</a>. Acknowledgements to those left off will be made in future releases.  Want to make sure you make it on the short list of contributors?  All you have to do is report an issue, fix a bug or help us determine the necessary requirements for a new feature!  Visit our <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS">Issue Tracker</a> to take part and get your name on the list of DSpace Contributors!</p>

<p>The Documentation Gardener for this release was Jeffrey Trimble with input from everyone. &nbsp;All typos are his fault.</p>

<p>Peter Dietz is the Release Coordinator of this release.  Tim Donohue helped out with coordinating the final days of the release.</p>

<p>Additional thanks to Tim Donohue from DuraSpace on keeping all of us focused on the work at hand, and calming us when we got excited and for the general support for the DSpace project.</p>
