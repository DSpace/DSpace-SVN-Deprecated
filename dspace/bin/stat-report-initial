# This script starts from the year and month specified below and works
# forward until the end of the current month, generating monthly reports
# from the dstat aggregation files.
#
# To customise for your own use change the $in_prefix, $in_suffix, $out_prefix, 
# $out_suffix, $start_year, $start_month, $dsrun and $out_directory variables 
# below.
# 
# If you wish to futher configure this script, you will need to edit the
# command being executed, which appears near the bottom of the page, and is 
# commented with "# The command to generate the report"
#
# For more information on using the ReportGenerator, use:
