<!-- JSP-UI Configurable Submission configuration file  -->

<!-- and number of the steps that occur in the Item Submission Process.   -->
<item-submission>

 <!-- The process-map maps collection handles to a particular Item         -->
 <!-- Submission Process.  This requires that a collection's name be       -->
 <!-- unique, even within a community. DSpace does however insure that each-->
 <!-- collection's handle is unique.  Process-map provides the means to    -->
 <!-- associate a unique collection name with an Item Submission process.  -->
 <!-- The process-map also provides the special handle "default" (which is -->
 <!-- never a collection), here mapped to "traditional". Any collection    -->
 <!-- which does not appear in this map will be associated with the mapping-->
 <!-- for handle "default".                                                -->
