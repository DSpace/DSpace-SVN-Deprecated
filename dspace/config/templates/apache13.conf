# This is the configuration file template for deploying DSpace under Tomcat 4.0
# and Apache 1.3.  This deploys DSpace as the "root" application - if the
# server is being used for other applications minor changes may be necessary.
# mod_ssl must be installed and enabled.  This file assumes mod_webapp (the
# connector for Tomcat/Apache) is installed.  The default Tomcat connector
# configuration is OK (Warp connector, on localhost port 8008).
# 
# Strings surround by @@ are replaced with the corresponding property from
# dspace.cfg.  For example @@dspace.url@@ would be replaced with the dspace.url
# property in dspace.cfg.  When org.dspace.administer.InstallConfigs is
# invoked, this file will be installed in the location specified by the
# config.template.apache13.conf property in dspace.cfg.
# 
# This file does most of the work - only minor changes are needed in the
# default Apache 1.3 configuration:
# 
#  - The ServerName must be set correctly
#  
#  - Any existing SSL virtual host should be removed/commented out
#  
#  - Set the User/Group and ServerAdmin properties appropriately
#
#  - Include this file!  e.g. Include /usr/local/apache/conf/dspace-httpd.conf
