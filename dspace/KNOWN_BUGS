[ 1206842 ] Count does not count all items
Where communities contain sub-communities, the count only indicates the number of items in 
collections that are directly in that community e.g. If collection A exists in Community A has 10 items and
collection B exists in Sub-community B which exists in Community A has 5 items, the count will only show 10
next to Community A and not 15.

Community A
Collection A [10]

Sub-community B
Collection B [5]
