[ 1088692 ] Edit item template as a collection administrator

The problem described below occurs only when the item template is defined
 during the create collection wizard.

If I check "New submissions will have some metadata already filled out
with defaults", during the create collection wizard, and then I log in as
a collection admin and try to edit the item template, I get an internal
server error.

[ 1105336 ] Inappropriate Auth required when creating collection
 
 Group G has at least ADD and WRITE permissions on
 Community Cy
 Logged in as anyone in G

 1) In Cy, create a new collection.

 2) Check none but "This collection will have delegated
 collection administrators"

 3) Click Next>.

 System shows you the 401/403 screen (Forbidden / Authorization required)

 Same result occurs immediately if you check "Some users will be able to
 submit to this collection".

 If you deselect all options, you can edit the collection details and
 select epeople to have read permissions, but get Auth Required when you
 try to commit the read permissions.
