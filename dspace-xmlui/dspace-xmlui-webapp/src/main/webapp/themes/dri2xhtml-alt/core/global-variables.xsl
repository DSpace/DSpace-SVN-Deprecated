        Theme path represents the full path back to theme. This is usefull for
        accessing static resources such as images or javascript files. Simply
        prepend this variable and then add the file name, thus
        {$theme-path}/images/myimage.jpg will result in the full path from the
        HTTP root down to myimage.jpg. The theme path is composed of the
        "[context-path]/themes/[theme-dir]/".
