* Language Packs are now a DSpace Addon. 
* They can be compiled into your dspace distro via the addition of '-P lang' to the active profiles, they are inactive by default. 
* If a UTF-8 properties file exists, then the non-UTF-* file has been removed to avoid confusion.
* The Maven build process supports native2ascii conversion on packaging of the Jar.
* When the profile is active, the jar will be a dependency compiled into all lib directories where dspace-api is present.
